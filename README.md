# Eyes Exercise

This is a simple js demo showing how event listeners can be used to get cursor location and then use that information to make the eyes of this character follow the cursor around.

## Roadmap

For this project, I don't have any future improvements planned. That said, I am curious about trying to build my own games/dynamic applications using event listeners on cursor movement so I'm sure that's next.
